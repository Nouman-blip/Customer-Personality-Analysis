# Customer Personality Analysis - Business Insights

I recently had the opportunity to analyze a fascinating dataset called "Customer Personality Analysis" from Kaggle. With the help of the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries, I extracted some valuable information from this dataset, which contains several columns such as birth_year, education, kidshome, teenhome, mntwines, mntfruit, mintfishproducts, mntmeatprodcut, mntsweatsprodcut, and campaigns.

After cleaning the data and adding some additional columns like age, expenses, and total_kid to gain insights into the company's ideal customer, here are some of the key findings:

1. Kids and expenses have a negative correlation, indicating that expenses decrease as the number of kids increases.

2. Wine purchases are most commonly paired with meat products, followed by sweet products, while fish products have the lowest sales in combination with wine.

3. Fruit purchases are most commonly paired with fish products, followed by sweet products, while wine products have the lowest sales in combination with fruit.

4. Meat purchases are most commonly paired with fish products, followed by wine products, while sweet products have the lowest sales in combination with meat.

5. Fish purchases are most commonly paired with fruit products, followed by sweet products, while wine products have the lowest sales in combination with fish.

6. Sweet purchases are most commonly paired with fish products, followed by fruit products, while wine products have the lowest sales in combination with sweets.

7. Customers with an average salary of $69K tend to buy more wines compared to other products.

8. Customers with a PhD and married status make more purchases compared to other education levels or marital statuses.

9. Married customers responded positively to all three wine campaigns.

10. Catalog is the most preferred purchase channel among customers.

11. Customers with a graduation level of education respond more frequently to campaigns compared to other levels.

12. The highest frequency of being married occurred around 41,712 times more often than any other marital status.

13. Customers with a graduation level of education visit the company's website more frequently compared to other education levels.

14. Wine had the highest sales in 2012 compared to the other two years.

These findings provide valuable insights for businesses aiming to understand their customer base and optimize their marketing strategies.
